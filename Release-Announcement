After an excessive amount of time, I've released MIME::Types 1.16. The
primary purpose of this release is compatibility with Ruby 1.9.1, but I
haven't ignored the latest IANA registered types. I have also picked up
a few other types that others submitted as patches and scanned through
the latest version (1.27) of the Perl MIME::Types library.

This is the last planned release of MIME::Types 1.x. Soon, I will be
releasing MIME::Types 2.0 with several planned enhancements to the data
querying and sources used.

= What is MIME::Types for Ruby?
It allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content type
based on the file's filename extension, or provides a list of extensions
associated with a MIME content type, if known.

== Requirements and Installation
PDF::Writer has been tested with Ruby 1.8.6, Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.1,
JRuby 1.1.6 (in Ruby 1.8 mode), and MacRuby 0.3.

Once these packages are installed, MIME::Types can be installed with:

Alternatively, you can use the RubyGems version of MIME::Types available

== MIME::Types 1.16
* Made compatible with Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, and 1.9.1.
* Switched to the 'hoe' gem system and added a lot of build-time tools.
* Updated the MIME types to the list based on the values in the Perl library
  version 1.27. Also updated based on external source information and bug
  reports.

== Acknowledgements
Thanks to Ryan Davis for ZenTest and Hoe, and @merbist for pushing me to
make a release.
